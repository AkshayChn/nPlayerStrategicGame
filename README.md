# Computing Equilibria in Finite N-Player Strategic Form Games

Given a finite n-player strategic form game, this program outputs the following:

1. All _strongly_ dominant strategies
2. All _weakly_ dominant strategies
3. All _very weakly_ dominant strategies
4. A strongly dominant strategy equilibrium, if one exists
5. All weakly dominant strategy equilibria, if they exist
6. All very weakly dominant strategy equilibria, if they exist
7. All _pure strategy Nash equilibria_, if they exist
8. _Maxmin_ values of all players and all their maxmin strategies
9. _Mimmax_ values of all players and all minmax strategy profiles against each player

### Requirements

Python 2.7

### Usage

`python main.py <gamut_game_file>`

### Input

This program takes in games generated by GAMUT in the `simple-output` format. This is the default output format of GAMUT.

### Other Info

- There is no restriction on the number of players or the number of strategies each player has.
- A few sample games are in the `games` folder to test on
