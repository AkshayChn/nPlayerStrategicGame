###Given a finite n-player strategic form game, this program outputs the following:

1- all strongly dominant strategies
2- all weakly dominant strategies
3- all very weakly dominant strategies

4- a strongly dominant strategy equilibrium, if one exists
5- all weakly dominant stragtegy equilibria, if they exist
6- all very weakly dominant strategy equilibria, if they exist

7- all pure strategy Nash equilibrium, if they exist
8-maxmin values of all players and all their maxmin strategies
9- mimmax values of all players and all minmax strategy profiles against each player
